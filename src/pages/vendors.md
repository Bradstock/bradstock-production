    ## Thank you for your interest in Vending at Bradstock

    Bradstock is a unique and magical event.  Our vendors add to the experience!  This is why we look to support local artisans, crafters and small businesses by offering a limited number of vending spots. We vet vendors so we have a diverse variety of wares & services.

    Food vending is limited and requires additional rules & processing with state & local organizations.  If you are interested in food vending, you can apply here,  but your application will be managed separately and have food specific terms  & conditions.

    **Please carefully review the Terms & Conditions defined in this application.**

    You will be notified if you are approved to vend this year.  There is a small vending fee that will be charged for each vending spot, this is in addition to festival tickets which are required for all to enter Bradstock.

    Once again, thank you for your interest & support.
