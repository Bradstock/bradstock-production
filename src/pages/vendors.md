  text_area: "## Thank you for your interest in Vending at Bradstock\n\nBradstock
    is a unique and magical event.  Our vendors add to the experience!  This is why
    we look to support local artisans, crafters and small businesses by offering a
    limited number of vending spots. We vet vendors so we have a diverse variety of
    wares & services.\n\nFood vending is limited and requires additional rules & processing
    with state & local organizations.  If you are interested in food vending, you
    can apply here,  but your application will be managed separately and have food
    specific terms  & conditions.\n\n**Please carefully review the Terms & Conditions
    defined in this application.**\n\nYou will be notified if you are approved to
    vend this year.  There is a small vending fee that will be charged for each vending
    spot, this is in addition to festival tickets which are required for all to enter
    Bradstock.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your interest & support.\n\n "
