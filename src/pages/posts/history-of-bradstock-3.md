We had a feeling XXI was going to be a good year – and it was! Bradstock XXI was especially memorable because we had our first nuptial celebration!  That's right, Lisa and Derrick were married on the Camp grounds Saturday morning. A gorgeous day for a beautiful couple and especially poignant as Derrick has been a sturdy Chief ever since Bradstock I  in Brad's backyard (I seem to recall he made at least one of the several beer runs that day). Love was in the air all weekend long. The Acoustic Stage continues to flourish with close to 40 acts scheduled over the weekend. And there were unconfirmed reports that the pavilion was the go to location for some after-hours acoustic jamming. Even though Sunday's weather turned overcast, the generosity of Bradstockers allowed a donation of $12,000 to be made to Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck.![](/images/118765515_2076712329138186_549938356276683492_n.jpg)

Bradstock XXII – double deuces – knocked it out of the park and took the cover off the ball. We seem to have found the groove here at Camp and the weather was the finest we have yet experienced in Center Moriches. XXII  saw the addition of the Flower Power stage bringing to three the number of spaces for our musicians to perform and attendees to enjoy.  In fact, with the number of acts now presenting over the weekend, it has become a real challenge to decide just where you want to be at any given time!  But that my friends is a good problem to have. The quality and variety of music and poetry is truly epic. And truly historical was the performance on the main stage Sunday,  when our own Andy Falco teamed up with David Bromberg to enchant us all with their acoustic abilities, downhome humor and vocal artistry. Wow! A $15,000 donation to the Camp was the perfect ending to XXII.

And on to XXIII. Our love affair with Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck is going strong. XXIII saw Bradstock's artists and stage crew step up their game with an orchestrated theme between the main, acoustic and flower power stages – “Pangea” - taking us back to the garden and exploring the concept that we are all one with each other and one with mother earth. And dear mother did have us quite excited with the prospect of Hurricane Hermine making an unwelcome entrance.  The forecast Saturday night for Sunday was high winds and heavy rains.   The Chiefs had to bear down hard to keep all systems go.  Sunday came with perhaps the most superb weather of any Bradstock ever. The fear of rain kept away a good number of Sunday attendees and brought the total receipts down but the Circle of Chiefs still was able to present the Camp with a $12,000 donation.
