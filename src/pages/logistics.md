    Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck – dedicated to the benefit of special needs individuals of Long Island and beyond – stands today, not from the efforts of one organization, but rather as a culmination of a tremendous wave of effort from many Rotary Clubs throughout District 7260.

    Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck, The Moriches Rotary Health Camp, Inc., maintains a more than 70-year track record for making the dreams of individuals with disabilities a reality. Each year, we invite thousands of campers to enjoy a session of summer fun at our 37-acre site on the shores of Kaler’s Pond in Center Moriches.

    At Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck, our campers experience the joys of boating, arts and crafts, music, adaptive sports and games, swimming, campfires and more. In a supportive environment, our counselors encourage campers to reach outside their comfort zones and join with their fellow campers in activities designed to enhance their lives.

    Looking back on [our history](https://camppaquatuck.com/about-the-camp/camp-history/), Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck extends the deepest gratitude to the volunteers, Rotarians, community organizations and the Pa-Qua-Tuck Squaws who made our special camp possible. We would not exist today without your help.
