    We have multiple food vendors at Bradstock.

    The US Coast Guard offers a basic menu of burgers & dogs, as well as breakfast for campers on Sunday morning.

    Food trucks are also onsite offering various items for lunch, dinner & breakfast for campers.

    Unlike other festivals, you can also bring your own snacks, drinks & meals to Bradstock ... we only ask that you clean up after yourself - leaving the camp better than you found it!

    Camp Pa Qua Tuck has limited parking, we have a parking crew that will help direct guests on where to park.   If you can car pool with friends, we'd appreciate it.  As the parking fields fill up you may need to park on Montauk Highway.  Please take care while parking and please be respectful of the team helping with parking, they are doing their best.

    If you require Handicapped Parking please let the parking team know and they will direct you on where to park.

    Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck – dedicated to the benefit of special needs individuals of Long Island and beyond – stands today, not from the efforts of one organization, but rather as a culmination of a tremendous wave of effort from many Rotary Clubs throughout District 7260.

    Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck, The Moriches Rotary Health Camp, Inc., maintains a more than 70-year track record for making the dreams of individuals with disabilities a reality. Each year, we invite thousands of campers to enjoy a session of summer fun at our 37-acre site on the shores of Kaler’s Pond in Center Moriches.

    At Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck, our campers experience the joys of boating, arts and crafts, music, adaptive sports and games, swimming, campfires and more. In a supportive environment, our counselors encourage campers to reach outside their comfort zones and join with their fellow campers in activities designed to enhance their lives.

    Looking back on [our history](https://camppaquatuck.com/about-the-camp/camp-history/), Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck extends the deepest gratitude to the volunteers, Rotarians, community organizations and the Pa-Qua-Tuck Squaws who made our special camp possible. We would not exist today without your help.
