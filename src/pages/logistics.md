  content: Camp Pa Qua Tuck allows Bradstock to offer camping for festival goers so
    they can stay the weekend and enjoy the festivities. As guests of the Camp, Bradstock
    Chiefs expect that those staying over night will be respectful of all Camp property,
    the Camp's neighbors, and other campers. <br><br>If not, Bradstock reserves the
    right to immediately expel unruly campers from camping and from the festival without
    refund. <br><br>The camp explicitly <strong>prohibits</strong>:<br>✗ Open campfires<br>✗
    Boating or swimming in Kaler's Pond<br>✗ Entry into camp buildings other than
    showers/toilets for campers<br><br>We expect the privilege to camp will not be
    abused by our <strong>✌ </strong>peace-loving &amp; considerate Bradstock family.

  content: 'Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck – dedicated to the benefit of special needs individuals
    of Long Island and beyond – stands today, not from the efforts of one organization,
    but rather as a culmination of a tremendous wave of effort from many Rotary Clubs
    throughout District 7260.Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck, The Moriches Rotary Health Camp, Inc.,
    maintains a more than 70-year track record for making the dreams of individuals
    with disabilities a reality. Each year, we invite thousands of campers to enjoy
    a session of summer fun at our 37-acre site on the shores of Kaler’s Pond in Center
    Moriches.At Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck, our campers experience the joys of boating, arts
    and crafts, music, adaptive sports and games, swimming, campfires and more. In
    a supportive environment, our counselors encourage campers to reach outside their
    comfort zones and join with their fellow campers in activities designed to enhance
    their lives.Looking back on <a href="https://camppaquatuck.com/about-the-camp/camp-history/">our
    history</a>, Camp Pa-Qua-Tuck extends the deepest gratitude to the volunteers,
    Rotarians, community organizations and the Pa-Qua-Tuck Squaws who made our special
    camp possible. We would not exist today without your help.For more information
