    ## What is Bradstock?

    Bradstock is a two-day multi-stage music and arts festival in its’ 31st year. Bradstock showcases local performers & artisans. Our mission is to have a good time for a good cause. And that is what we have done. Everyone – musicians too - volunteer their time, energy and effort to make this festival what it is. Friends of Bradstock, Inc is a 501c3 not for profit organization with proceeds after expenses donated to local Long Island charitable organizations.

    Bradstock’s primary beneficiary since 2011 has been Camp-Pa-Qua-Tuck, a summer day camp for children with special needs. In the past proceeds have gone to the Long Island Maritime Museum, Friends of Connetquot River State Park, the Sayville Kiwanis Club, G.R.O.W., WUSB, They Often Cry Out, the Unbroken Chain Foundation, the Sayville Village Improvement Society, the Bayport and West Sayville Civic Associations and the Peconic Baykeeper. Island Harvest has regularly received both monetary donations and food stuffs brought to the festival by attendees.
