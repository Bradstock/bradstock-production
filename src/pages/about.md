      ## Our History


      Over Labor Day weekend in 1994, several friends from the Bayport-Sayville
      area organized a day of music, food and fun. Held in the backyard of
      Bayport resident Brad Ringhouse, the event, which proved to be a rousing
      success, was aptly dubbed “Bradstock.” 


      With enthusiasm sky high, the all-volunteer organizers planned Bradstock
      II for the following Labor Day. However, two extra ingredients were to be
      added to the original, successful formula - a focus on our environment,
      and a determination to raise funds to donate to area organizations. 


      The good time had by all was to be complemented with a good cause
      supported by all. Which is exactly what has happened.

      With the buzz of the first two Bradstocks encouraging new participants to
      join the cause, and with the success of the festivals far surpassing what
      the organizers could have ever imagined, Bradstocks III and IV were held
      on the grounds of Meadowcroft in Bayport. Artists came to display their
      work, various not-for-profit environmental organizations set up
      informative, educational booths, and new musicians eagerly joined
      Bradstock‘s solid line-up of performers. Best of all, the events generated
      profits, as well as canned foodstuffs, which was donated and distributed
      to local good causes.

      ### Our Mission


      Thanks to the generosity of the many friends of Bradstock, in the past
      twenty-eight years we have donated over $300,000 including $145,000 to
      Camp-Pa-Qua-Tuck. 


      Other beneficiaries include the 


      * Long Island Maritime Museum

      * Friends of Connetquot River State Park

      * The Sayville Kiwanis Club

      * G.R.O.W.

      * WUSB

      * They Often Cry Out

      * The Unbroken Chain Foundation

      * The Sayville Village Improvement Society

      * The Bayport and West Sayville Civic Associations 

      * The Peconic Bay Keeper


      Our friends from the U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association,
      man and woman the grills to keep us in grub over the weekend. The profits
      from the sale of the food goes to fund their own charitable cause – and
      they kick in a contribution to Bradstock as well. 


      Over these many years, the Bradstock organization has donated a mountain
      of food and ongoing monetary contributions to Island Harvest to help those
      less fortunate than ourselves.  

        
      We are confident that the Circle of Chiefs moves forward in a manner
      befitting the labor that we expend. **_May the circle be unbroken._**
