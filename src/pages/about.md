    from the Bayport-Sayville area organized a day of music, food and fun. Held in
    the backyard of Bayport resident Brad Ringhouse, the event, which proved to be
    a rousing success, was aptly dubbed “Bradstock.” With enthusiasm sky high, the
    all-volunteer organizers planned Bradstock II for the following Labor Day. However,
    two extra ingredients were to be added to the original, successful formula - a
    focus on our environment, and a determination to raise funds to donate to area
    organizations. The good time had by all was to be complemented with a good cause
    supported by all. Which is exactly what has happened.\n\n#### Building a Community\n\n
    With the buzz of the first two Bradstocks encouraging new participants to join
    the cause, and with the success of the festivals far surpassing what the organizers
    could have ever imagined, Bradstocks III and IV were held on the grounds of Meadowcroft
    in Bayport. Artists came to display their work, various not-for-profit environmental
    organizations set up informative, educational booths, and new musicians eagerly
    joined Bradstock‘s solid line-up of performers. Best of all, the events generated
    profits, as well as canned foodstuffs, which was donated and distributed to local
    good causes.\n\n####  Our Mission\n\n  \n Thanks to the generosity of the many
    friends of Bradstock, in the past twenty-three years we have donated over $275,000
    including $120,000 to Camp-Pa-Qua-Tuck. Other beneficiaries include the Long Island
    Maritime Museum, Friends of Connetquot River State Park, the Sayville Kiwanis
    Club, G.R.O.W., WUSB, They Often Cry Out, the Unbroken Chain Foundation, the Sayville
    Village Improvement Society, the Bayport and West Sayville Civic Associations
    and the Peconic Baykeeper And let’s not forget our friends from the U.S. Coast
    Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, who man and woman the grills to keep us
    in grub over the weekend. The profits from the sale of the food goes to fund their
    own charitable cause – and they kick in a contribution to Bradstock as well. And
    over these many years, the Bradstock organization has donated a mountain of food
    and ongoing monetary contributions to Island Harvest to help those less fortunate
    than ourselves. The Chiefs presented a check for $3,000 to Island Harvest at this
    year’s Platinum Party.  \n We are confident that the Circle of Chiefs moves forward
    in a manner befitting the labor that we expend. **_May the circle be unbroken._**"
