    the Bayport-Sayville area organized a day of music, food and fun. Held in the
    backyard of Bayport resident Brad Ringhouse, the event, which proved to be a rousing
    success, was aptly dubbed “Bradstock.” \n\nWith enthusiasm sky high, the all-volunteer
    organizers planned Bradstock II for the following Labor Day. However, two extra
    ingredients were to be added to the original, successful formula - a focus on
    our environment, and a determination to raise funds to donate to area organizations.
    \n\nThe good time had by all was to be complemented with a good cause supported
    by all. Which is exactly what has happened."

  content: "With the buzz of the first two Bradstocks encouraging new participants
    to join the cause, and the success of the festivals far surpassing what the
    organizers could have imagined, Bradstocks III and IV were held on the grounds
    of Meadowcroft in Bayport. 
    \n\n
    Artists came to display their work, not-for-profit
    environmental organizations set up informative, educational booths, and new musicians
    eagerly joined Bradstock‘s solid line-up of performers. Best of all, the events
    generated profits, as well as canned foodstuffs, which were donated and distributed
    to local causes.

    Since those early years, our Bradstock family has grown exponentially.  Multiple generations of Bradstockers now attend, and new festival goers are discovering this unique community, held together with a common love of music, the arts, a spirit of giving back, and most of all, a good time.
    \n\n
    It’s now thirty plus years later, and the circle of kinship and belonging lives on.
    
    ### Our Mission\n\nThanks to the generosity of the many friends of Bradstock,
    in the past twenty-eight years we have donated over $300,000 including $175,000
    to Camp-Pa-Qua-Tuck. \n\nHere are some of our other beneficiaries include the \n\n* Long Island Maritime
    Museum\n* Friends of Connetquot River State Park\n* The Sayville Kiwanis Club\n*
    G.R.O.W.\n* WUSB\n* They Often Cry Out\n* The Unbroken Chain Foundation\n* The
    Sayville Village Improvement Society\n* The Bayport and West Sayville Civic Associations
    \n* The Peconic Bay Keeper\n\nAlong with local food trucks, our friends from the U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty
    Officers Association, man and woman the grills to keep us in grub over the weekend.
    The profits from the sale of the food goes to fund their own charitable cause
    – and they kick in a contribution to Bradstock as well. \n\nOver these many years,
    the Bradstock organization has donated a mountain of food and ongoing monetary
    contributions to Island Harvest to help those less fortunate than ourselves. 
    \n\n  \nWe are confident that the Circle of Chiefs moves forward in
    a manner befitting the labor that we expend. **_May the circle be unbroken._**"
